# OperatingSystemPoll
My very first major Java program, created with IntelliJ IDEA using Java 16, which I created for my current Computer Science course, Intro to Software Systems, as a weekly assingment. Current Java project uses major programming concepts such as data types, object oriented programming design/classes, iteration/loops, arraylists, and graphical user interface. 
Objectives of the program are to implement JFrames, JPanels, JComponents, JButtons, JLabels, and JTextfield, ActionListeners, to create a pop-up window and implements a poll of Operating Systems and asks the user to select various options using buttons or type in their own option using a textfield(s) which is then collected in an arraylist and has an option to show a stacked bar graph, using graphical user interfaces, given the data from the arraylist of data for each category.
